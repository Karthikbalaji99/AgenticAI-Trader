# Agentic AI for Trading with Python

## Overview
Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and act autonomously to achieve a goal. These agents typically use reinforcement learning (RL) methods to optimize their behaviour over time through interactions with an environment.

In this project, we build an AI Agent for stock trading using Agentic AI concepts and Python.

## Understanding the Components of Agentic AI

- **The Agent**: The decision-making entity that selects actions based on the environment. Here, we use a DQN (Deep Q-Network) trading agent to make trading decisions.
  
- **The Environment**: The external system with which the agent interacts. In our case, the stock market, using historical stock data.

- **The State**: The information available to the agent at any point. For our trading agent, it includes the stock’s closing price, simple moving averages, and daily returns.

- **The Action Space**: The set of all possible actions the agent can take: Buy, Sell, or Hold.

- **The Reward Function**: Defines the feedback to the agent. The agent’s objective is to maximize total profit by the end of a trading session.

## Building the Trading AI Agent

### 1. Data Collection
We collect Apple's stock market data (AAPL) from Yahoo Finance, using libraries such as `yfinance`.

### 2. Environment Setup
An environment is created where the agent can simulate trades:
- States are constructed based on indicators and past prices.
- Actions affect the agent's portfolio and cash holdings.
- Rewards are given based on the change in portfolio value.

### 3. Deep Q-Network (DQN) Agent
The DQN agent:
- Takes a state as input.
- Predicts Q-values for each possible action.
- Chooses the action with the highest Q-value, balancing exploration and exploitation.
- Updates the Q-values by learning from the reward received.

### 4. Training the Agent
The agent is trained over multiple episodes, with each episode representing one trading period. It learns to optimize returns by adjusting its trading strategy.

### 5. Testing and Evaluation
Once trained, the agent is tested on unseen data to evaluate:
- Cumulative returns
- Volatility
- Sharpe Ratio (risk-adjusted returns)

## Key Takeaways
- **Agentic AI** allows autonomous decision-making in dynamic environments.
- **Reinforcement Learning** is powerful for optimizing sequential decision-making problems like trading.
- **Deep Q-Learning** can be successfully applied to model and simulate trading strategies.
- **Risk management** and proper evaluation are crucial for deploying AI-based trading systems.

## Future Improvements
- Implement more sophisticated RL algorithms like PPO or A3C.
- Use more financial indicators (MACD, RSI, etc.) for state construction.
- Train on multiple stocks to create a generalized portfolio management agent.
- Include transaction costs and slippage for realistic trading simulations.
